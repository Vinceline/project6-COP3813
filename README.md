Hello,

This repository contains files for Project 6 for the class COP3813.

Lab 15.18 utilizes Pug templates to dynamically create HTML files. 
Template 1 demonstrates basic HTML syntax, including lists, images with attributes, tables, and sections. 
Template 2 uses a loop through an array of states and their populations to create a list. 
Template 3 employs a mixin with a block to render several statements.
Template 4 uses the personCard mixin to create a function that renders a personâ€™s profile card with specific attributes. The data for the people is defined in index.js.

Lab 17.10 focuses on improving the accessibility of a given HTML file based on accessibility standards.
